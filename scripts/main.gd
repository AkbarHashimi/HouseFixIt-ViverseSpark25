# pseudo code

'''
// Level reads input

// Get viable moves from Path2D? of tile player stands on
	// player.location?
	// array of tiles?
	// get info from tile node?

// Level moves player object to new tile
	// direction interpreted from input
	// add displacemet to player.location
	// player.x += move_x
	// player.y += move_y

// Signal is emmitted from tile that was left
	// house/gas/traffic/regular have different signals
	// day counter/gas counter affected differently by player state
	// Signal has info about tile that was left
	
// Level updates gas can & day counter
	// gas can takes extra toll on traffic roads
	// day get incremented more if player is driving through traffic

// Car node only exists to track location if player is not in it
	// Otheriwise hide/delete the object until player exits
	// Gas can is handled by Level

// Player node exists to manipulate sprites and keep track of location
	// Movement/day counter is handled by Level
